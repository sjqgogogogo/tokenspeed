"""Marlin W4A16 MXFP4 MoE over DeepEP all-to-all (SM90).

The replicated-token Marlin path runs every rank over the full token batch and
all-reduces; with attention DP that additionally needs a cross-DP all-gather.
This kernel replaces both collectives with DeepEP's token-level legs: dispatch
routes each token only to the ranks owning its top-k experts, the local Marlin
grouped GEMM computes those experts' contributions, and combine reduces the
per-expert partials back to the token's home rank.

Activations stay bf16 on the wire (Marlin is weight-only quant; there is no
FP8 activation form to exploit), so dispatch carries a single bf16 tensor.

Both DeepEP modes are supported, and their receive layouts differ:

- Normal (extend-shaped): flat rows with rank-local ``topk_ids`` whose
  non-local slots arrive as -1. Marlin consumes those ids directly, and the
  route weights fold into GEMM2 so combine reduces unweighted.
- Low-latency (decode-shaped): a padded per-expert buffer
  ``[num_local_experts, recv_m, hidden]`` with ``masked_m`` valid rows per
  expert and no ids. A device-side count-driven Marlin schedule covers only
  valid rows; the real route weights are applied by the low-latency combine
  leg.

Intranode traffic runs the NVLink P2P fast path in both modes; the IBGDA
requirement only bites for internode low-latency traffic.
