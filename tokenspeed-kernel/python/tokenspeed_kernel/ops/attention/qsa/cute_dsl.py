        k_cache: BF16 or FP8 E4M3 key cache shaped
            ``[cache_slots, kv_heads, 256]``, with 1, 2 or 4 KV heads.
        v_cache: BF16 or FP8 E4M3 value cache shaped
            ``[cache_slots, kv_heads, 256]``. Its dtype must match ``k_cache``.
        selected_slots: Physical cache slots shaped ``[tokens, 2051]``;
            non-positive values are ignored.
        scale: Softmax scale applied to query-key scores.
        max_seqlen_q: Uniform query-token count per request; 1 for decode and
            ``spec_num_tokens`` for compact speculative decode.
        metadata_capacity_rows: Ignored because this implementation is
            workspace-free.
        k_scale: Scalar key-cache descale, folded into ``scale``.
        v_scale: Scalar value-cache descale, applied to the output.

    Returns:
        BF16 attention output shaped ``[tokens, query_heads, 256]``.

    Each KV head owns a contiguous group of query heads, divided into tiles
    of up to eight heads. One CTA cluster handles each (row, KV head, head
    tile), sharing that row's selected slots. Head counts and cache strides
    are compile-time parameters; a six-query-head, one-KV-head launch retains
    its original tile geometry. This also covers the twelve- and twenty-four-
    query-head shapes used with smaller tensor-parallel sizes.

    Small launches use sixteen sequence-split CTAs when the device occupancy
    probe allows all clusters to fit in one wave, otherwise eight CTAs for up
    to eight clusters and four for larger launches. All split counts use the
    same asynchronous K/V ring and head-owning DSM softmax combine. The final
    three selected entries are computed in that combine, avoiding a mostly
    empty tensor-core tile. BF16 V staging uses transposed matrix loads.
