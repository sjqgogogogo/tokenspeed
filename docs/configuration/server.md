# Server Parameters

This page documents the parameters operators usually set directly. TokenSpeed
uses familiar serving parameter names where the semantics match and keeps
TokenSpeed-specific knobs for runtime features with different meaning.

For a compact compatibility table, see
[Compatible Parameters](./compatible-parameters.md).

## Model Loading

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| positional `model` | Model path or Hugging Face repo ID. |
| `--model` | Equivalent to positional `model`. |
| `--tokenizer` | Tokenizer path when it differs from the model path. |
| `--tokenizer-mode` | Select tokenizer behavior. `auto` uses fast tokenizers and model-specific hooks when available. |
| `--skip-tokenizer-init` | Skip tokenizer initialization for input-ID-only serving paths. |
| `--load-format` | Weight loading format: `auto`, `pt`, `safetensors`, `instanttensor`, `npcache`, `dummy`, or `extensible`. See [InstantTensor](/guides/instanttensor) for the accelerated NVIDIA loader. |
| `--trust-remote-code` | Allow custom model code from the model repository. |
| `--revision` | Model branch, tag, or commit. |
| `--download-dir` | Hugging Face download/cache directory. |
| `--hf-overrides` | JSON overrides for model configuration values. |

## Precision And Quantization

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--dtype` | Model weight and activation dtype. `auto` follows model metadata. |
| `--kv-cache-dtype` | KV cache dtype. Lower precision reduces KV memory and may require scaling factors. |
| `--kv-cache-quant-method` | KV cache quantization method. |
| `--quantization` | Weight quantization mode such as `fp8`, `nvfp4`, `w8a8_fp8`, or `compressed-tensors`. |
| `--quantization-param-path` | JSON file for KV cache scaling factors, commonly needed with FP8 KV cache. |

## API Surface

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--host` | HTTP bind host. |
| `--port` | HTTP bind port. |
| `--served-model-name` | Model name returned by the OpenAI-compatible API. |
| `--api-key` | API key required by the server. |
| `--chat-template` | Built-in chat template name or template file path (handled by the smg gateway). |
| `--stream-interval` | Streaming buffer interval in generated tokens. Smaller values stream more frequently. |
| `--stream-output` | Return generated text as disjoint streaming segments. |
| `--weight-version` | Initial model-weight version stamped into generation metadata. Defaults to `default`. |

### Weight Version Metadata

Every generation response includes the current version in
`meta_info["weight_version"]`. RL trainers can use this value to identify the
policy version that produced a sample.

The SGLang-compatible `update_weights_from_distributed`,
`update_weights_from_tensor`, and `update_weights_from_disk` requests accept an
optional `weight_version`. The version changes only after the update succeeds;
omitting it preserves the current value.

Use `GET /get_weight_version` to read the current value,
`POST /update_weight_version` with `{"new_version": "..."}` to set it directly,
and `GET /model_info` to read the model path and version together.

### Slime RL Compatibility

TokenSpeed exposes the SGLang HTTP surface used by slime. The supported path is
an externally launched TokenSpeed rollout engine on separate GPUs, using full
NCCL weight updates and TokenSpeed data-parallel size 1:

- rollout: `POST /generate`, `POST /abort_request`, `GET /v1/loads`, and
  `GET /health_generate`;
- update coordination: `POST /pause_generation`,
  `POST /continue_generation`, and `GET /flush_cache`;
- NCCL weight sync: `POST /init_weights_update_group`,
  `POST /update_weights_from_distributed`, and
  `POST /destroy_weights_update_group`;
- memory control: `POST /release_memory_occupation` and
  `POST /resume_memory_occupation`.

Use TokenSpeed's control-server address, not its OpenAI gateway address, as the
external rollout-engine address. Real rollout log probabilities require
`--enable-output-logprobs`.

The following slime paths are not yet supported end to end:

- colocated CUDA-IPC updates through `update_weights_from_tensor`;
- quantized-update hooks `post_process_weights` and `weights_checker`;
- disk-delta `pull_weights`;
- slime's retained top-p token set (`rollout_top_p != 1.0`). Use
  `--rollout-top-p 1.0` until TokenSpeed returns that metadata;
- rollout routing replay (`--use-rollout-routing-replay`).

The HTTP route for `update_weights_from_tensor` remains for SGLang clients, but
TokenSpeed's scheduler does not yet implement its CUDA-IPC receive path. Use the
distributed update mode until that implementation is added.

## Scheduler And Memory

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--max-model-len` | Maximum sequence length. If omitted, TokenSpeed uses the model config. |
| `--gpu-memory-utilization` | Fraction of GPU memory used for model weights and KV cache. Lower it to leave headroom. |
| `--max-num-seqs` | Maximum number of active sequences the scheduler may process concurrently. |
| `--chunked-prefill-size` | Token budget the scheduler may issue in one iteration. Defaults to `8192`. Set `-1` to disable chunked prefill. |
| `--max-prefill-tokens` | Prefill token budget used when chunked prefill is disabled. Defaults to `8192`. |
| `--max-total-tokens` | Override the automatically calculated token pool size. |
| `--block-size` | KV cache block size. |
| `--enable-prefix-caching` / `--no-enable-prefix-caching` | Enable or disable prefix cache reuse. |
| `--enforce-eager` | Disable device-graph execution (CUDA Graph on CUDA, ACL Graph on NPU). |
| `--disable-prefill-graph` | Keep prefill eager while leaving decode device graphs enabled. |
| `--max-cudagraph-capture-size` | Largest decode batch size to capture as a device graph. |
| `--cudagraph-capture-sizes` | Explicit decode batch sizes to capture as device graphs. |

`--chunked-prefill-size` is intentionally separate from
`--max-num-batched-tokens`: in TokenSpeed it is the scheduler's per-iteration
issue budget, while `--max-total-tokens` controls the global token pool.

## Parallelism

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--tensor-parallel-size`, `--tp` | Familiar alias for setting attention tensor parallel size. |
| `--attn-tp-size` | Tensor parallel size for attention. |
| `--dense-tp-size` | Tensor parallel size for dense layers. Defaults to the attention replica width (attn TP x CP): the full world without DP attention, one replica with it. |
| `--moe-tp-size` | Tensor parallel size for MoE layers. |
| `--data-parallel-size` | Number of data-parallel replicas. |
| `--mm-encoder-tp-mode` | Multimodal encoder parallelism: `weights` shards encoder weights with attention TP; `data` uses TP1 whole-item DP and currently requires aggregate serving and no attention context parallelism. |
| `--enable-expert-parallel` | Set expert parallelism across the selected world size. |
| `--expert-parallel-size`, `--ep-size` | Explicit expert parallel size. |
| `--world-size` | Total worker process count across all nodes. |
| `--nprocs-per-node` | Worker process count per node. |
| `--nnodes` | Number of nodes. |
| `--node-rank` | Rank of the current node. |
| `--dist-init-addr` | Distributed initialization address. |

Use `--tensor-parallel-size` for simple launches. Use the
TokenSpeed-specific split knobs when attention, dense, and MoE layers need
different process groups.

## Backend Selection

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--attention-backend` | Attention kernel backend. Common values include `mha`, `fa3`, `fa4`, `triton`, `flashinfer`, `trtllm_mla`, and `tokenspeed_mla`. |
| `--drafter-attention-backend` | Attention backend for speculative decoding drafter model. |
| `--moe-backend` | MoE backend. |
| `--draft-moe-backend` | MoE backend for the speculative decoding draft model. |
| `--all2all-backend` | MoE all-to-all backend. |
| `--deepep-mode` | DeepEP mode: `auto`, `normal`, or `low_latency`. |
| `--low-latency-max-num-tokens-per-gpu` | DeepEP send capacity per rank. K3 token dispatch sizes from the maximum per-DP verify batch after TP slicing; pinned low latency also covers prefill/recovery chunks. Other models use 256. Explicit insufficient K3 capacity fails at startup. |
| `--sampling-backend` | Sampling backend: `greedy`, `flashinfer`, `flashinfer_full`, `triton`, or `triton_full`. |

Set backend choices explicitly in production. `auto` is useful for bring-up, but
explicit values make benchmark comparisons and regressions easier to reason
about.

When `--dp-sampling` is enabled, the logits processor owns the per-forward
logits layout decision and carries the resulting plan to the sampling backend
with the logits output.

## Reasoning And Tool Calling

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--reasoning-parser` | Parser for extracting reasoning content from model outputs (handled by the smg gateway). |
| `--tool-call-parser` | Parser for OpenAI-compatible tool-call payloads (handled by the smg gateway). |
| `--enable-custom-logit-processor` | Allow custom logit processors. Keep disabled unless the deployment needs it. |

Common reasoning parser values include `kimi_k25`, `base`, `qwen3`,
`deepseek_r1`, and `deepseek_v31`. Common tool-call parser values include
`kimik2`, `qwen`, `deepseek_v4`, `json`, and `passthrough`. The parser names
are validated by the SMG gateway, so use
the values accepted by the bundled `tokenspeed-smg` package.

## Speculative Decoding

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--speculative-config` | JSON speculative decoding configuration. |
| `--speculative-algorithm` | Speculative algorithm, such as `EAGLE3`, `MTP`, `DFLASH`, or `DSPARK`. |
| `--speculative-draft-model-path` | Draft model path or repo ID. |
| `--speculative-draft-model-quantization` | Draft model quantization. Defaults to `unquant`. |
| `--speculative-num-steps` | Number of draft model steps. Defaults to `3`. |
| `--speculative-num-draft-tokens` | Number of draft tokens. Defaults to `--speculative-num-steps + 1`. |
| `--speculative-eagle-topk` | EAGLE top-k. Defaults to `1`. |
| `--eagle3-layers-to-capture` | EAGLE3 layers to capture. |

Prefer `--speculative-config` for recipe-style launches because it keeps method,
draft model, and token count together.

`DFLASH` and `DSPARK` are block drafters: one draft forward proposes a whole
block instead of one token per step, so their two token counts are coupled.
`--speculative-num-draft-tokens` is the verify width -- one anchor row plus one
row per drafted token -- and `--speculative-num-steps` must be one less. The
draft checkpoint's `block_size` fixes both, and a mismatch is rejected at
startup rather than silently drafting a wrong-width block. A checkpoint with
`block_size: 8` therefore wants `--speculative-num-draft-tokens 8
--speculative-num-steps 7`.

A checkpoint whose architecture is `DFlash2DraftModel` uses the same `DFLASH`
launch method. TokenSpeed selects its grouped-convolution and candidate-selector
runtime from the checkpoint architecture; no separate algorithm flag is needed.
Draft proposals greedily follow the selector's transition-conditioned path,
independent of the target sampling backend.

A block drafter writes its KV at the target's cache locations, so it shares the
target's page table: `--block-size` is a target-side choice and the draft
follows it. Any sliding window the draft checkpoint declares is an attention
mask applied by the draft's own layers, never a cache-retention policy of its
own.

## Observability

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--log-level` | Runtime log level. |
| `--log-level-http` | HTTP server log level. Defaults to `--log-level` when unset. |
| `--enable-log-requests` | Log request metadata and optionally payloads. |
| `--log-requests-level` | Request logging verbosity. |
| `--enable-log-request-stats` | Log a one-line per-request performance summary on finish/abort (see below). |
| `--enable-metrics` | Enable metrics reporting. |
| `--metrics-reporters` | Metrics reporter, such as `prometheus`. |
| `--decode-log-interval` | Decode batch log interval. |
| `--enable-cache-report` | Include cached-token counts in OpenAI-compatible usage details. |
| `--kv-events-config` | JSON config for KV cache mutation events. Set `enable_kv_cache_events` and a publisher such as `zmq` to publish device prefix-cache stores and removals. |

Set `TOKENSPEED_LOG_SPEC_ACCEPT_LENGTHS=1` to log each speculative verify
step's committed widths and accepted draft-token counts. This reads the
already-synchronized CPU result and does not add a GPU synchronization, but it
is intentionally verbose and should only be enabled while debugging. For
decode-only batches it also logs the anchor, draft candidates, target verify
tokens, and their position-wise matches.

### Per-Request Stats

`--enable-log-request-stats` enriches the scheduler's per-request finish line for
latency/throughput debugging. When set, the `Req: <rid> Finish! ...` line carries
a Python-object repr (`RequestStats(...)`) instead of the default
`Accept_num_tokens_avg` value (which it subsumes as `acc_len`). Every field is
derived from host-side timestamps and counters already available in the
scheduler — it adds **no GPU sync** and so no engine slowdown. Example:

```
Req: chatcmpl-019ef6b7 Finish! RequestStats(status='finished', reason='stop', prompt_tokens=28684, cache_tokens=832, output_tokens=33, cache_hit_rate=0.029, queue_ms=13.8, prefill_ms=15.8, ttft_ms=42.1, total_ms=58.0, preempt_ms=0.0, preempt_count=0, decode_tps=210.4, acc_len=None, acc_rate=None, recv_ts=1782255696.726, commit_ts=1782255696.74, finish_ts=1782255696.784)
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `status` / `reason` | `finished` vs `aborted`; finish-reason type (`stop`/`length`/`abort`). |
| `prompt_tokens` / `cache_tokens` / `output_tokens` | Prompt tokens, prefix-cache-hit tokens, generated tokens. |
| `cache_hit_rate` | `cache_tokens / prompt_tokens` (0–1). |
| `queue_ms` | Received → first scheduled into a forward batch. |
| `prefill_ms` | Scheduled → prefill complete. |
| `ttft_ms` | Received → first output token (always ≥ `prefill_ms`; it also spans the queue). |
| `total_ms` | Received → finished/aborted. |
| `preempt_ms` / `preempt_count` | Wall-clock this request's decode was delayed by prefilling other requests, and the number of such interruptions. Host-side best-effort. |
| `decode_tps` | Decode throughput (generated tokens / decode window). |
| `acc_len` / `acc_rate` | Spec-decode acceptance length and rate (`None` when speculative decoding is off). |
| `recv_ts` / `commit_ts` / `finish_ts` | Absolute epoch timestamps for received / scheduled / finished. |

### KV Cache Events

KV cache events publish reusable device prefix-cache mutations from the live
C++ scheduler path. Host/L2 loadback events are not published by this initial
stream. Block hash lineage is cached on prefix-cache nodes, so publishing a
stored block uses the parent node's cached hash instead of rebuilding the full
ancestor prefix.

Example:

```bash
--kv-events-config '{"enable_kv_cache_events":true,"publisher":"zmq","endpoint":"tcp://*:5557","topic":"kv-events"}'
```

The ZMQ publisher sends three frames: topic bytes, an 8-byte big-endian sequence
number, and a msgpack payload. The payload is an array-like `KVEventBatch`:

```python
[timestamp, [["BlockStored", [block_hash], parent_hash, token_ids, block_size]], attn_dp_rank]
[timestamp, [["BlockRemoved", [block_hash]]], attn_dp_rank]
```

With attention data parallelism, each attention DP rank publishes on an offset
port from the configured endpoint.
