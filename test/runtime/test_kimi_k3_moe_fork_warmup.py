"""``KimiLinearMoE`` must exercise its auxiliary stream during graph warmup.

``_capture_one`` runs several warmup forwards on the capture stream before
recording, and documents that "capture-only auxiliary branches use this graph
phase to warm their own streams serially". Honouring that contract requires
gating the stream fork on the graph *phase* and gating only the overlap on
capture mode.

Gating ``enable`` on capture mode instead left the auxiliary stream untouched
until capture itself. The first hipBLASLt call on that stream then performed its
lazy handle/workspace setup inside the capturing stream, which HIP rejects with
"operation not permitted when stream is capturing" (900) on every rank, and
startup deadlocked with the GPUs idle. It reproduced on gfx950 at TP8/EP1 --
where the tensor-parallel MoE places a projection on the forked branch -- while
TP8/EP8 captured cleanly, so the config coverage matters as much as the flag.

The TP8/EP1 CI jobs that exercise the real failure are manual-trigger only, so
this is the only per-commit signal guarding the contract. It is a deliberately
narrow one: it pins the enable/overlap decision at the call site, not the effect
on the auxiliary stream, so it would not catch a change to StreamFork's own
semantics. Run the EP1 perf job for that.

CPU-only: no real streams or capture, just the enable/overlap decision.
